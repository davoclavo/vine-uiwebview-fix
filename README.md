Vine UIWebView Fix
==================

When opening a vine.co link in any application, it opens it on a UIWebView block. These blocks don't allow media to autplay by Apple policies.

This is a small workaround to fix this issue.

To test it, go to [http://davoclavo.co/vine-uiwebview-fix](http://davoclavo.co/vine-uiwebview-fix) from any UIWebView instance. *For example, open the url on Google Chrome on your iOS device*
